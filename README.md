# prompt-engineering-project


📌 Project Overview

This project explores different Prompt Engineering techniques to understand how LLMs (Large Language Models) process and respond to various types of inputs. Rather than focusing on perfect results, our goal was to learn how different prompting strategies affect responses and how to structure prompts effectively.

✅ Techniques Covered

1️⃣ Zero-Shot Prompting

The model is given a question without any examples.

Purpose: Tests the model’s baseline knowledge and ability to generate responses without guidance.

Example:

Q: What is machine learning?
A: Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data...

2️⃣ Few-Shot Prompting

The model is provided with a few examples before being asked a question.

Purpose: Improves accuracy by showing a pattern that the model can follow.

Example:

Translate English to French:
- Apple → Pomme
- House → Maison
- Car → ?

(Expected Response: "Voiture")

3️⃣ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

The model is instructed to explain its reasoning step-by-step before giving an answer.

Purpose: Encourages structured thinking and improves responses in complex tasks (math, logic, reasoning).

Example:

Q: If a train leaves at 3 PM traveling at 60 mph, and another train leaves at 4 PM traveling at 80 mph, when will they meet?
A: Step 1 - Calculate the distance difference...

🛠 Observations & Challenges

Zero-shot worked well for factual questions but struggled with ambiguous tasks.

Few-shot prompting improved accuracy, but required well-structured examples.

CoT prompting sometimes failed because our base model (Falcon-7B) wasn't optimized for deep reasoning.

Choosing the right prompting technique is key to getting meaningful responses.

📌 Key Takeaways

✅ Prompt engineering is an iterative process.
✅ Choosing the right prompting technique improves response quality.
✅ Model selection impacts reasoning abilities.
✅ Even imperfect results help us understand LLM behavior.

📌 Future Enhancements

Test with larger, more reasoning-capable models (e.g., Mistral-7B, GPT-4).

Explore multi-turn conversations where context is carried across prompts.

Optimize prompts for specific real-world applications (e.g., coding assistance, creative writing).

This project provides a structured approach to learning prompt engineering, making it a great starting point for understanding how LLMs process text differently based on input structure. 🚀
